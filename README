# Satellite Multi-Hop Queuing Models for the Space IoT

Modelling the Low-Orbit Satellite Communication System using Queing Models. <br/>
Each node is constrained to receive Poisson or/and Periodic traffics in a cascaded fashion. <br/>
The metric, **Age of Information** is found out theoretically and by simulation for a given model. <br/> 
Various methods have been tried to minimize AoI. <br/>
