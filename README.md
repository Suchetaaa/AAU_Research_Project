# Satellite Multi-Hop Queuing Models for the Space IoT

This project dealt with modelling low-orbit Satellite Communication System using Queing Models. <br/>
1. The model consists of cascaded nodes that model like channels or servers.
2. Each node is constrained to receive Poisson or/and Periodic traffics in a cascaded fashion. 
3. The metric, **Age of Information** is found out theoretically and by simulation for a given model.  
4. Various methods have been tried to minimize AoI. <br/> <br/>
Submitted a paper to **IEEE** **International Conference on Communications** **2020** (under review) <br/>
